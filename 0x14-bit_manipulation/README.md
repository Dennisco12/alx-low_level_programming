* 0-binary_to_uint.c: function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
* 1-print_binary.c: function that prints the binary representation of a number
* 2-get_bit.c: function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
* 3-set_bit.c: function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
* 4-clear_bit.c: function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
* 5-flip_bits.c: function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
